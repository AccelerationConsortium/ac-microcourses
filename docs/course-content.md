## 🚀 Getting Started

These courses are integrated with coding exercises via GitHub Classroom, so you will need [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (naming convention: John H. Smith → `jhsmith` or Jane M. Doe → `jane-doe`).

**👉 First Step**: Complete the [🔗 GitHub starter tutorial](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/github-starter-course) to familarize yourself with the assignment structure and keep everyone on the same page.

**👉 Second Step**: Complete the [🔗 Intro to GitHub Classroom tutorial](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/intro-github-classroom) to familarize yourself with the assignment structure and keep everyone on the same page.

<!-- As [mentioned in the overview](/courses/hello-world/overview.md), each course is comprised of modules, where each module typically has three components:


|  | Component | Points |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1. | 🧭 Guided tutorial | 0 |
| 2. | 📓 Notebook assignment | 5 |
| 3. | 🛠️ Mini project | 10 | -->

<!-- If you've reached this point, and you're wondering what a self-driving lab is in the first place, watch [▶️ "The Future of Chemistry is Self-driving"](). *TODO: Video needs to be edited and uploaded to YouTube. Add this as an embedded iframe perhaps* -->
