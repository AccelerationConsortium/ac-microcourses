# 📚 Course Content

<!-- All modules, all on one page via nbgallery? -->

If you've already completed the [Certificate Overview](certificate-framework.md), you're ready to dive into the course content! If not, we recommend you start there.

## 🚀 Getting Started
As [mentioned in the overview](/courses/hello-world/overview.html#course-assessments-and-grading-schema), each course is comprised of modules, where the typical structure for each module is:

1. A guided notebook tutorial (ungraded)
2. A standalone notebook assignment (graded)
3. A mini project (graded)

To familarize yourself with the assignment structure and to keep everyone on the same page, complete the[🔗 GitHub starter tutorial](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/github-starter-course).

<!-- If you've reached this point, and you're wondering what a self-driving lab is in the first place, watch [▶️ "The Future of Chemistry is Self-driving"](). *TODO: Video needs to be edited and uploaded to YouTube. Add this as an embedded iframe perhaps* -->

## 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs
```{note}
This course is a recommended prerequisite for all other courses in the certificate, and a mandatory prerequisite for the in-person capstone project.
