# 📚 Course Content

<!-- All modules, all on one page via nbgallery? -->

```{warning}
If you've already completed the [Certificate Overview](certificate-framework.md), you're ready to dive into the course content! If not, we recommend you start there.
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

<!-- As [mentioned in the overview](/courses/hello-world/overview.md), each course is comprised of modules, where each module typically has three components:


|  | Component | Points |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1. | 🧭 Guided tutorial | 0 |
| 2. | 📓 Notebook assignment | 5 |
| 3. | 🛠️ Mini project | 10 | -->

These courses are integrated with coding exercises via GitHub Classroom, so you will need [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (naming convention: John H. Smith → `jhsmith` or Jane M. Doe → `jane-doe`).

**👉 First Step**: Complete the [🔗 GitHub starter tutorial](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/github-starter-course) to familarize yourself with the assignment structure and keep everyone on the same page.

<!-- If you've reached this point, and you're wondering what a self-driving lab is in the first place, watch [▶️ "The Future of Chemistry is Self-driving"](). *TODO: Video needs to be edited and uploaded to YouTube. Add this as an embedded iframe perhaps* -->

## 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs

<!-- ```{note}
**This tutorial requires physical hardware and a 2.4 GHz WPA-2 wireless network**. If you do not have the hardware, see the ⭐ DigiKey Order link at the bottom-left of the [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/186289-autonomous-research-laboratories). If you do not have the required wireless network, you can use a mobile hotspot (see [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83)).
``` -->

<!-- ```{note}
🔑 The "Hello World" course is a **recommended prerequisite** for all other courses in the certificate, and a mandatory prerequisite for the in-person capstone project.
