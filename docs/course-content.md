# 📚 Course Content

<!-- All modules, all on one page via nbgallery? -->

If you've already completed the [Certificate Overview](certificate-framework.md), you're ready to dive into the course content! If not, we recommend you start there.

## 🚀 Getting Started
As [mentioned in the overview](/courses/hello-world/overview.md), each course is comprised of modules, where each module typically has three components:


|  | Component | Points |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1. | 🧭 Guided tutorial | 0 |
| 2. | 📓 Notebook assignment | 5 |
| 3. | 🛠️ Mini project | 10 |


These courses are integrated with coding exercises via GitHub Classroom. To familarize yourself with the assignment structure and keep everyone on the same page, complete the [🔗 GitHub starter tutorial](https://github.com/AC-Classroom/github-starter-course).

<!-- If you've reached this point, and you're wondering what a self-driving lab is in the first place, watch [▶️ "The Future of Chemistry is Self-driving"](). *TODO: Video needs to be edited and uploaded to YouTube. Add this as an embedded iframe perhaps* -->

## 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs
