  description: "Discover the essential principles of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) by building a 'Hello World' SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication via MQTT, database integration via MongoDB, microcontroller programming with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, and optimization via the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data."

  course_assessments_and_grading_schema: "Performance in this course is assessed via rubrics that evaluate the quality of the proposal, design/build, and stages. The proposal rubric evaluates the schematic figure, white paper, and presentation. The design rubric evaluates the design, implementation, and documentation. The build rubric evaluates the build, implementation, and documentation. Each module is worth 100 points."
