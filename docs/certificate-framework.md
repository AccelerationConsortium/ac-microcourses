# Microcourses

Here, we provide details for the five core microcourses, including title, description, learning outcomes, skills, and modules.

## üí° Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs

Discover the essential principles of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) by building a "Hello World" SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication via MQTT, database integration via MongoDB, microcontroller programming with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, and optimization via the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data. For participants to complete this course within the expected timeframe (15-20 hours), intermediate proficiency in Python programming is recommended.

### üéØ Learning Outcomes <!-- Merge LO and C/S? into table? Maybe not - implies one-to-one correspondence between the lines-->

- Describe key terms and principles of self-driving labs
- Send commands and receive sensor data over WiFi using standard frameworks such as MQTT
- Store experiment configurations and results in a MongoDB database
- Implement software on a microcontroller to adjust device power and read sensor data
- Adapt a Bayesian optimization script from packages such as the Ax Platform to iteratively suggest new colors to try <!-- Bayes opt YouTube video here, in data science, or in both? EDIT: data science -->

- Modify the system to record temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and accelerometer measurements

### üõ†Ô∏è Competencies/Skills
- Basic self-driving lab literacy
- Database management
- Workflow orchestration
- Bayesian optimization
