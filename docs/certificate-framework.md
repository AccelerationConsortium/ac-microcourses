# Microcourses

Here, we provide details for the five core microcourses, including title, description, learning outcomes, skills, and modules.

## üí° Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs

Discover the essential principles of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) by building a "Hello World" SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication via MQTT, database integration via MongoDB, microcontroller programming with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, and optimization via the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data. For participants to complete this course within the expected timeframe (15-20 hours), intermediate proficiency in Python programming is recommended.

### üéØ Learning Outcomes <!-- Merge LO and C/S? into table? Maybe not - implies one-to-one correspondence between the lines-->

- Describe key terms and principles of self-driving labs
