# üìú Autonomous Systems for Discovery Certificate

While advanced materials hold the potential to improve our lives and our world, conventional methods of discovery are slow and expensive. "Self-driving" (i.e., autonomous) laboratories have the power to radically fast-track materials discovery‚Äîfrom an average of 20 years and $100 million to as little as 1 year and $1 million. This paradigm shift requires highly qualified personnel and multidisciplinary expertise. While extensive degree-based training can provide deep expertise in a single field, formal education options which provide needed cross-disciplinary skills are unavailable. This certificate will address this gap with training that introduces self-driving labs, provides deeper dives into data science, robotics, and software development, and facilitates a capstone project. Each course will contain a series of hands-on guided tutorials and coding exercises for participants to adapt and apply what they've learned.

## üéØ Certificate Learning Outcomes

- Recreate a color-matching self-driving lab from scratch using RGB LEDs, a color sensor, a microcontroller, and Python
- Write a Python script that uses AI to iteratively suggest next experiments
- Use a database backend to programatically upload and retrieve materials data
- Write a Python script to orchestrate experimental and computational workflows
- Leverage state-of-the-art software development tools and implement best practices
- Develop, defend, and execute a project proposal for a self-driving lab

## üéì Courses

As an introduction, participants will design and build a "Hello World" for self-driving labs using physical hardware and Python. The certificate also provides deeper dives into data science, robotics, and software development. After completing these deeper dives, participants will be able to write a Python script that uses AI to iteratively suggest next experiments, use a database backend to programatically upload and retrieve materials data, and write a Python script to orchestrate experimental and computational workflows. Likewise, participants will be able to leverage state-of-the-art software development tools using best practices while implementing solutions to maximize efficiency and minimize frustration.

The certificate culminates in a project proposal which participants will develop, defend, and execute at the Acceleration Consortium's in-person training facility. This experience will provide familiarity with education- and research-grade equipment including liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms, a vertical lift module, and synthesis and characterization modules. Together, the learning outcomes of this certificate will provide a familiarity with the terminology, principles, and tools required for the highly interdisciplinary teams necessary to build state-of-the-art self-driving labs.

### üëã Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs
