## ðŸ”° Tutorial

In this module, you will learn advanced GitHub features and collaborative workflows. By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

1. Work with GitHub Issues
2. Create and manage Pull Requests
3. Collaborate effectively with other developers
4. Use branches for feature development
5. Resolve merge conflicts
6. Utilize GitHub for project management

### GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are a great way to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects.

#### Steps to create an issue:
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click on the "Issues" tab.
3. Click the "New issue" button.
4. Enter a title and description for your issue.
5. Assign labels, milestones, and assignees if needed.
6. Click "Submit new issue".

#### Example:
```markdown
Title: Add user authentication feature

Description:
We need to implement user authentication for our web application. This should include:
- User registration
- Login/Logout functionality
- Password reset option

Please use JWT for token-based authentication.
```

**Documentation**: [About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests (PRs) let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

#### Steps to create a Pull Request:
1. Create a new branch and make your changes.
2. Push the branch to GitHub.
3. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
4. Click "Pull requests" and then "New pull request".
5. Select your branch to compare with the base branch.
6. Enter a title and description for your PR.
7. Click "Create pull request".

#### Example PR Description:
```markdown
## Description
This PR implements user authentication using JWT.

## Changes
- Added user registration endpoint
- Implemented login/logout functionality
- Created password reset feature

## Testing
- All new endpoints have been tested manually
- Added unit tests for authentication functions

Please review and let me know if any changes are needed.
```

### Collaborative Coding

Collaborative coding on GitHub involves working with others on the same project, often simultaneously.

#### Best Practices:
1. Communicate clearly in issues and pull requests.
2. Use descriptive commit messages.
3. Review others' code thoroughly and provide constructive feedback.
4. Keep pull requests focused and small when possible.

#### Example of a Good Commit Message:
```
Add password strength checker to registration form

- Implement zxcvbn library for password strength calculation
- Display strength meter below password field
- Show suggestions for stronger passwords
```

### Branches

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

#### Steps to create a new branch:
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your repository.
3. Create and switch to a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
```

4. Make your changes and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement user registration"
```

5. Push the branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
```

**Documentation**: [About Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)

### Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

#### Steps to resolve a merge conflict:
1. Open the conflicting file in your text editor.
2. Look for the conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
3. Decide which changes to keep.
4. Remove the conflict markers.
5. Add your changes and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in user authentication"
```

#### Example of a Merge Conflict:
```python
<<<<<<< HEAD
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Implementation using bcrypt
=======
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Implementation using argon2
>>>>>>> feature/improve-authentication
```

### Project Management

GitHub provides tools for project management, including project boards, milestones, and labels.

#### Steps to create a new project:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of your repository.
2. Click on the "Projects" tab.
3. Click "New project".
4. Choose a project template or start from scratch.
5. Name your project and add a description.
6. Click "Create project".

#### Example Project Setup:
1. Create a new project named "Web Application Development".
2. Add columns: "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done".
3. Create issues for different features and add them to the "To Do" column.
4. Assign team members to issues and move them to "In Progress" when work begins.
