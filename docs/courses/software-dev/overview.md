# üë©‚Äçüíª Software development for self-driving labs

Elevate your software development skills in the context of self-driving laboratories. This asynchronous, remote course introduces software development concepts and best practices and productivity tools such as integrated development environments (IDEs) with VS Code, unit testing with pytest, continuous integration via GitHub actions, and documentation creation using Sphinx and Read the Docs. You'll also learn to deploy materials discovery campaigns on cloud servers or dedicated hardware and run offline simulations using cloud hosting.




## üîë Recommended Prerequisites

The **recommended prerequisite** for this course is Introduction to AI for Discovery using Self-driving Labs



## üéØ Learning Outcomes


- List software development best practices and corresponding benefits
- Identify productivity tools for developers that increase efficiency
- Write unit tests using tools such as pytest
- Create Python documentation using sphinx and rtd
- Implement continuous integration (CI) using tools such as GitHub actions
- Create a project template using PyScaffold
- Launch a cloud server or server on dedicated local hardware that runs a materials discovery campaign
- Run an offline simulation using cloud hosting
