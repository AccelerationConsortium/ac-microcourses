# AC Training Lab Design Project

Turn your self-driving lab expertise into a real-world project. During this course, you will propose, design, and build a self-driving laboratory at the AC training lab equipped with education- and research-grade equipment including liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, and mobile robotic arms. Prior to arrival, you'll create schematic figures, write white papers, and present your proposals to a team of scientists. During a week-long in-person experience, you'll implement your proposal and document your progress. After the visit, you will share your designs, data, and documentation to contribute to the public knowledge base.
