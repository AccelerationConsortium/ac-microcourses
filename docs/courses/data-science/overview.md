<!-- In intro, require Bayes opt video and user input for the different questions. This could be a GitHub discussion, comments in a PR, entry in the Canvas course, etc. -->

<!-- Mixed-variable optimization | Numerical parameters, categorical parameters |  -->

<!-- Module: Large language models for materials discovery @KevinJablonka can perhaps convert his 1-hr tutorial into this one -->

<!-- Noisy optimization | Bayesian optimization<br>Observation noise<br>Noisy expected improvement (NEI) | Explain the effect of observation noise on optimization<br>Compare the efficiency of expected improvement and NEI as a function of observation noise -->

<!-- NOTE: Moving workflow orchestration to robotics, with a covalent tutorial in hello world -->
