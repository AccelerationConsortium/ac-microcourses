# üß© 2.3 Batch Optimization

## üìö Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Understand the principles of batch optimization
- Implement batch-based Bayesian optimization
- Handle constraints in optimization problems
- Analyze optimization results effectively

## üî∞ Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- Basic understanding of Gaussian Processes
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of optimization concepts

### Required Packages
```python
ax-platform>=0.3.0    # For Bayesian optimization
numpy>=1.20.0         # For numerical operations
pandas>=1.3.0         # For data manipulation
scipy>=1.7.0          # For scientific computing
```

## üìñ Core Concepts

### Batch Optimization
Batch optimization allows for parallel evaluation of multiple design points, which is particularly useful when:
- Experiments are time-consuming
- Multiple samples can be processed simultaneously
- Resource constraints exist

### Key Components
1. **Sampling Strategies**
   - Initial Sobol sampling for exploration
   - Batch Thompson sampling for exploitation
   - Trade-off between exploration and exploitation

2. **Constraint Handling**
   - Device/system constraints
   - Parameter bounds
   - Feasibility checks

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Optimization convergence
   - Batch diversity
   - Constraint satisfaction

## üí° Implementation Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Parameter Setup**
   - Validate parameter ranges
   - Check for constraint feasibility
   - Use appropriate data types

2. **Optimization Process**
   ```python
   # Example structure
   for batch in range(n_batches):
       # Get next batch of parameters
       parameters = get_next_batch()
       
       # Check constraints
       validate_constraints(parameters)
       
       # Run experiments
       results = run_batch_experiments(parameters)
       
       # Update model
       update_optimization_model(results)
   ```

3. **Results Analysis**
   - Track convergence
   - Monitor constraint violations
   - Analyze batch diversity

### Common Pitfalls
- Not handling constraints properly
- Insufficient initial exploration
- Poor parameter scaling
- Inadequate error handling

## ü§î FAQ

1. **Q: Why use batch optimization?**  
   A: Batch optimization is efficient when experiments are time-consuming and multiple trials can be run in parallel.

2. **Q: How to handle failed experiments?**  
   A: Implement proper error handling and consider using robust optimization strategies.

3. **Q: What's the optimal batch size?**  
   A: It depends on your resources and the trade-off between exploration and exploitation.

## üìù Notes
