### Demo

âœ… Read [HR Analytical Balance Literature](https://weighing.andonline.com/sites/default/files/documents/HR-A_HR-AZ%20Lit_web.pdf)

âœ… Skim [HR Analytical Balance Manual](https://weighing.andonline.com/sites/default/files/documents/HR-A_HR-AZ_Manual.pdf). Read Sections 15 and 17 closely.

âœ… Read [this RS232 ChatGPT transcript](https://chatgpt.com/share/eb858762-b80f-4a4d-bd12-0a4a47f116f9)

âœ… Read about [code for Adafruit RS232 Pal](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rs232-pal/circuitpython-and-python) (note, this is for CircuitPython and Python, not MicroPython, so it's informative only)


Run the following code on your microcontroller:

```python
import machine
import utime

# Initialize UART
uart = machine.UART(1, baudrate=9600, tx=machine.Pin(4), rx=machine.Pin(5))

# Send the "Q" command and read response
uart.write(b"Q\r\n")
utime.sleep(0.1)
if uart.any():
    print(uart.read().decode("utf-8"))

# Continuous reading loop
while True:
    if uart.any():
        print(uart.read().decode("utf-8"))
    utime.sleep(1)
```

## ðŸ“„ Assignment

Create a script that requests the weight data continuously for 5 seconds, requests the stabilized weight, and then re-zeros the scale (i.e., similar to what might happen if it were to be synchronized with a peristaltic pump calibration).
