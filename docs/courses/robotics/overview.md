# Robotics: Course Overview



Embark on a journey into the world of robotics and automation for self-driving laboratories. This asynchronous, remote course equips you with the skills to control peristaltic pumps, linear actuators, automated liquid handlers, and solid dispensers using a microcontroller, a motor driver, and a workflow orchestration package. You'll also learn to control mobile cobots and perform spatial referencing and ID recognition via computer vision. The course will conclude with a solid sample transfer workflow using a multi-axis robot. Remotely accessible resources will be provided as necessary.
