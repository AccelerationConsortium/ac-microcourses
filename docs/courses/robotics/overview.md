# ü¶æ Autonomous Systems for Self-driving Labs

Embark on a journey into the world of robotics and automation for self-driving laboratories. This asynchronous, remote course equips you with the skills to control peristaltic pumps, linear actuators, automated liquid handlers, and solid dispensers using a Pico W microcontroller, a motor driver, and the Prefect workflow orchestration package. You'll also learn to control mobile cobots using the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework and to perform spatial referencing and ID recognition via AprilTags and OpenCV. The course will conclude with a solid sample transfer workflow using Prefect, ROS, AprilTags, OpenCV, and a multi-axis robot.
