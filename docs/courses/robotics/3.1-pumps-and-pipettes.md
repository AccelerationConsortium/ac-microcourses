## ðŸ”° Tutorial

In this module, you will develop software to:
1. manage a peristaltic pumpâ€™s operations using a microcontroller and motor driver
2. manipulate the linear actuator of the Digital Pipette

### Peristaltic Pump

First, you will manage a peristaltic pumpâ€™s operations using a microcontroller and motor driver. Consider purchasing the hardware and setting it up yourself to enhance the experience. Hardware is optional for the completion of this module.

#### Demo

âœ… Read the [MDD3A DC Motor Driver datasheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ax3gSo0srTzoSr2bo8ETLym0OqrYjlk_JCZK4kxtfXg/edit?usp=sharing)

âœ… Read [PWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation)

âœ… Read [Control LED brightness with PWM](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/7)

âœ… Read [machine.PWM](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/rp2/quickref.html#pwm-pulse-width-modulation)

Use your knowledge, the documentation above, and any relevant datasheets to set up the circuit to control the peristaltic pump. After setting up the hardware, run the following code on the microcontroller (ensure you select the appropriate PWM Pin):

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
from time import sleep

pwm = PWM(Pin(0))

pwm.freq(1000)

pwm.duty_u16(16384)  # 25% duty cycle
sleep(5)  # 5 seconds

pwm.duty_u16(0)  # stop the motor
```

You should observe the peristaltic pump turn on for five seconds.

### Digital Pipette

Next, you will control the linear actuator of the "Digital Pipette" to carry out precise dispensing.

## ðŸ“„ Assignment

Create a script that allows you to set peristaltic pump power as a fraction and then perform a calibration to determine a power to flow rate conversion for the peristaltic pump.

âœ… See an example calibration procedure in [Peristaltic Pump Calibration](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18t2_kxa8xe1a8FoVrQRKD_lHAqVDYKhnHKoxriJCWNc/edit?usp=sharing).

Create a script that allows you to set Digital Pipette actuator position as a fraction from 0 to 1 and then perform a calibration to determine a pulse length to volume ratio. Note also the calibration procedure from the manuscript linked above.

Create a script that allows you to make four 90 degree rotations each spaced by 5 seconds.

Create a script that controls the fan to keep the temperature below a certain threshold.
