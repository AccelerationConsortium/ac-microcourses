## ðŸ”° Tutorial

In this module, you will perform liquid transfer between containers with an automated liquid handler (Science Jubilee and Opentrons OT-2).

### Science Jubilee

Science Jubilee is an extension to Jubilee, an open-source multi-tool motion platform. While Jubilee was originally designed as a versatile 3D printer capable of automatically swapping custom tools, Science Jubilee adapts this technology for scientific experiments.

The Science Jubilee system is particularly valuable in research settings where flexibility and customization are key. It allows researchers to automate various laboratory tasks beyond just liquid handling, making it a versatile tool for interdisciplinary research.
