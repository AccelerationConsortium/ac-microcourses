### Science Jubilee

Science Jubilee is an extension to Jubilee, an open-source multi-tool motion platform. While Jubilee was originally designed as a versatile 3D printer capable of automatically swapping custom tools, Science Jubilee adapts this technology for scientific experiments.

The Science Jubilee system is particularly valuable in research settings where flexibility and customization are key. It allows researchers to automate various laboratory tasks beyond just liquid handling, making it a versatile tool for interdisciplinary research.

#### Cool Features 😎

- **Tool Swapping** 🔄: Can switch between pipettes, cameras, and other tools automatically.
- **Custom Tools** 🛠️: Researchers can design and 3D print new tools for specific experiments.
- **Open Source** 📖: The design is freely available, allowing for customization and improvement by the scientific community.
