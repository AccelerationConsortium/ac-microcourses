    "Chemistry and materials research data is precious. By making your data **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)), you can maximize the impact of your research. Here are two conceptual examples of what FAIR data might look like in the physical sciences:\n",

    "## Writing to MongoDB Using the Data API\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a popular [\"NoSQL\"](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) database, to store our data. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that it stores data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is a popular choice for IoT applications because it is easy to set up and use, and it is highly scalable. MongoDB also has a [Data API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/data-api/) that allows you to read and write data directly from a microcontroller. For the purposes of this tutorial, a free-tier test database has been set up for you. Here, we provide you with an API key for test purposes. To avoid misuse that could arise from distributing a public API key (normally bad practice), only write permissions have been granted, and the database is set to autodelete entries once a certain storage threshold has been reached.\n",
