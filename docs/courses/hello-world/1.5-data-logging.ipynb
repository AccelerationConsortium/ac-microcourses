It's important to note that MongoDB is just one of many excellent choices for databases. It's a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is a popular choice for internet-of-things (IoT) applications due to its ease of setup, use, and scalability. Additionally, MongoDB offers a [Data API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/data-api/) that allows for direct reading and writing of data from a microcontroller.\n",

However, [costs will escalate quickly if the database is not optimized](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/serverless-instances-billing-optimize-bill-indexing/) (e.g., the database is not indexed). If you decide to go with MongoDB Atlas for a project and need more than the 512 MB of free-tier storage, we recommend first considering the shared (e.g., M2, M5) and dedicated options, hosting your own MongoDB instance, or looking to other ecosystems. Looking to other ecosystems could be either a full replacement or a supplement. For example, let's say that one step in your workflow involves capturing images, where the total storage required is on the order of GBs instead of MBs. Instead of saving your images directly to MongoDB (e.g., using [GridFS or the `BinData` type](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/)), you can upload your image to [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) or similar and add the uniform resource identifier (URI) to the corresponding MongoDB document along with other data like sample name, image acquisition parameters, material composition, and processing conditions. The URI can then later be used to [programatically access the file from Amazon S3](https://chat.openai.com/share/4ec06c80-8915-4b21-9b3c-4e7a9abb186a)."
