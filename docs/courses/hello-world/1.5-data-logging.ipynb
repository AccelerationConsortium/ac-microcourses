It's important to note that MongoDB is just one of many excellent choices for databases. It's a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is a popular choice for internet-of-things (IoT) applications due to its ease of setup, use, and scalability. Additionally, MongoDB offers a [Data API](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/data-api/) that allows for direct reading and writing of data from a microcontroller.\n",

However, [costs will escalate quickly if the database is not optimized](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/serverless-instances-billing-optimize-bill-indexing/) (e.g., the database is not indexed). If you decide to go with MongoDB Atlas for a project and need more than the 512 MB of free-tier storage, we recommend first considering the shared (e.g., M2, M5) and dedicated options, hosting your own MongoDB instance, or looking to other ecosystems.
