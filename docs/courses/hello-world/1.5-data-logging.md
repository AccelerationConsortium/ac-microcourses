### FAIR Data

Chemistry and materials research data is precious. By making your data **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)), you can maximize the impact of your research. Here are two conceptual examples of what FAIR data might look like in the physical sciences:

### # Updating Pico W to Use AWS Lambda for MongoDB Interaction

For storing our data, we will be using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as before, but instead of using MongoDB's Data API directly, we'll be using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) as an intermediary. AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It's an excellent choice for creating lightweight APIs and handling intermittent requests, which is perfect for our IoT application.

By using AWS Lambda in conjunction with [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), we can create a secure and scalable API that acts as a bridge between our Pico W and MongoDB. This approach offers several advantages:

1. Enhanced security: We can implement more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
2. Flexibility: We can easily add data processing or validation logic before writing to MongoDB.
3. Cost-effective: Lambda's pay-per-use model can be more economical for intermittent data logging.

For this tutorial, we've set up a Lambda function that connects to our MongoDB database. The function is triggered via an API Gateway endpoint, which the Pico W will call to log data. To maintain security, the API Gateway is configured with an API key, and the Lambda function has the necessary permissions to write to MongoDB.

âœ… Copy the following code into a new file on the microcontroller called `write_aws_lambda.py` and run the file. Note that you will need [`netman.py`](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/blob/main/src/public_mqtt_sdl_demo/lib/netman.py) [[permalink](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/blob/0ff0adec3e997c096990de594844d73a9ce18fd6/src/public_mqtt_sdl_demo/lib/netman.py)] and a file named `my_secrets.py` with your WiFi credentials, course ID, and the AWS API Gateway URL and API key.

This guide explains how to modify the Pico W code to use AWS Lambda as a data API interface for MongoDB, instead of using MongoDB's Data API directly.

## Setting up AWS Lambda and API Gateway

## Required Reading Materials

- [AWS Lambda Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [AWS API Gateway Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico W Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html)

## Required Python Files

1. `main.py`: Contains the modified code above
2. `netman.py`: Module for WiFi connection (remains unchanged)
3. `my_secrets.py`: Contains WiFi credentials and COURSE_ID

## Setting up AWS Lambda and API Gateway for MongoDB Integration

Follow these steps to set up AWS Lambda and API Gateway to interact with MongoDB:

1. Create an AWS Lambda function:
   - Go to AWS Lambda console and click "Create function".
   - Choose "Author from scratch" and give your function a name.
   - Select Python as the runtime.
   - Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions.

2. Set up the Lambda function:
   - In the function code, paste the Python code provided in the "Lambda Function Code" section below.
   - Add the `pymongo` layer to your Lambda function for MongoDB connectivity.
   - In the function configuration, add an environment variable for your MongoDB connection string.

3. Create an API Gateway:
   - Go to API Gateway console and create a new REST API.
   - Create a new resource and add a POST method.
   - Set the integration type to "Lambda Function" and select your created function.

4. Set up API Key:
   - In API Gateway, create a new API key.
   - Associate this key with your API and deployed stage.

5. Deploy the API:
   - Deploy your API to a new stage (e.g., "prod").
   - Note the invoke URL - this will be your `AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL`.
   - Note the API key - this will be your `AWS_API_KEY`.

6. Update your Pico W code:
   - Set up the AWS API Gateway URL and API key in your `my_secrets.py` file.
   - Prepare the document data to be sent in your main script.
   - Send a POST request to the AWS API Gateway.
   - Handle the response and implement retry logic if necessary.

7. Ensure security:
   - Verify that the Lambda function has appropriate permissions to access MongoDB.
   - Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

By following these steps, you'll have set up a serverless API that allows your Pico W to securely write data to MongoDB through AWS Lambda.
## Code Modifications

Modify the `main.py` file as follows:

```python
from netman import connectWiFi
import urequests
from my_secrets import SSID, PASSWORD, COURSE_ID, AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL, AWS_API_KEY

connectWiFi(SSID, PASSWORD, country="US")

headers = {"x-api-key": AWS_API_KEY}
document = {"course_id": COURSE_ID}

print(f"Sending document to AWS Lambda")

num_retries = 3
for _ in range(num_retries):
    response = urequests.post(AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL, headers=headers, json=document)
    txt = str(response.text)
    status_code = response.status_code

    if status_code != 200:
        print("Retrying in 5 seconds...")
        time.sleep(5)

    print(f"Response: ({status_code}), msg = {txt}")

    response.close()

    if status_code == 200:
        print("Added Successfully")
        break

    print("Retrying...")
```


### Example of `my_secrets.py`:

```python
SSID = "Your_WiFi_SSID"
PASSWORD = "Your_WiFi_Password"
COURSE_ID = "Your_Course_ID"
AWS_API_GATEWAY_URL = "Your_API_Gateway_Invoke_URL"
AWS_API_KEY = "Your_API_Key"
```

## Example Lambda Function (Python)
```python
import json
import pymongo
import os


def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        client = pymongo.MongoClient(os.environ["MONGODB_URI"])
        db = client["your_database_name"]
        collection = db["your_collection_name"]

        body = json.loads(event["body"])
        result = collection.insert_one(body)

        return {
            "statusCode": 200,
            "body": json.dumps(
                {
                    "message": "Document inserted successfully",
                    "id": str(result.inserted_id),
                }
            ),
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "statusCode": 500,
            "body": json.dumps(
                {"message": "Error inserting document", "error": str(e)}
            ),
        }
```

The output should look something like the following (MAC address and IP address redacted, and your insertedId will be different):

> ```python
> MAC address: ***
> connected
> ip = ***
> sending document to AWS Lambda
> Response: (200), msg = {"message": "Document inserted successfully"}
> Added Successfully
> ```

As a side note, MongoDB has a "serverless" option (i.e., pay only for what you use) that exceeds the free-tier limits and is more flexible than the shared and dedicated clusters, which may seem appealing at first. However, [costs will escalate quickly if the database is not optimized](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/serverless-instances-billing-optimize-bill-indexing/) (e.g., the database is not indexed). If you decide to go with MongoDB Atlas for a project and need more than the 512 MB of free-tier storage, we recommend first considering the shared (e.g., M2, M5) and dedicated options, hosting your own MongoDB instance, or looking to other ecosystems. Looking to other ecosystems could be either a full replacement or a supplement.

```{tip}
Upload larger files to [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) and store the URI in MongoDB.

For example, let's say that one step in your workflow involves capturing images, where the total storage required is on the order of GBs instead of MBs. Instead of saving your images directly to MongoDB (e.g., using [GridFS or the `BinData` type](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/)), you can upload your image to [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) or similar and add the uniform resource identifier (URI) to the corresponding MongoDB document along with other data like sample name, image acquisition parameters, material composition, and processing conditions. The URI can then later be used to [programatically access the file from Amazon S3](https://chat.openai.com/share/4ec06c80-8915-4b21-9b3c-4e7a9abb186a).
