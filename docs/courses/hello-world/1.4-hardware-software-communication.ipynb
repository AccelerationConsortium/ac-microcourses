    "âœ… If you haven't already, follow Step 13b with the Software setup section of the Build Instructions manuscript [ðŸ”— DOI: 10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102329](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2023.102329) (pages 11-12 in the PDF) to create your own HiveMQ cluster and security certificate.

Ensure that your microcontroller has been set up according to the instructions in the \"Running the demo\" module earlier in the course. You will also need to upload the [`mqtt_as.py` module](https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-mqtt/blob/master/mqtt_as/mqtt_as.py) (either in the main directory or in the `lib` folder). Make sure to replace `<your_id_here>` with your course ID (without the brackets). Save the file and click play.\n",
