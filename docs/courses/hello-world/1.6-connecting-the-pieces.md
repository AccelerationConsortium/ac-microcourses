## ðŸ”° Tutorial

```{warning}
As a temporary workaround to the issue described in https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15112, add [`urequests_2.py`](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses/blob/main/docs/courses/hello-world/urequests_2.py) to your microcontroller, and change `import urequests` to `import urequests_2 as urequests` in the code below.
```

You've made it to the final module of this microcourse! Well done ðŸ¥³. In this module, you will connect the pieces from previous modules into the "Hello World" of self-driving labs, from microcontroller programming and Bayesian optimization to hardware-software communication and data logging.

âœ… Review the tutorials from the earlier modules. Direct links to the tutorial pages are copied here for convenience:

1. [Running the demo](./1.1-running-the-demo)
2. [Blink and read](./1.2-blink-and-read)
3. [Bayesian optimization](./1.3-bayesian-optimization)
4. [Hardware-software communication](./1.4-hardware-software-communication)
5. [Data logging](1.5-data-logging)

### Data Logging with PyMongo

In the previous module, you learned how to log data using PyMongo directly within orchestrators. For detailed instructions, refer to the [PyMongo tutorial notebook](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/courses/hello-world/1.5.1-pymongo.html).

This approach allows you to efficiently manage data from your microcontroller using a full Python environment, leveraging the capabilities of PyMongo for database interactions.

### Final Steps

âœ… Review the knowledge checks via the main course website

âœ… Review your assignment repositories. For quick access, see [your ACC-HelloWorld GitHub organization repositories](https://github.com/orgs/ACC-HelloWorld/repositories).

## Course Completion

For those who have completed the course, thank you for your participation, and congratulations! ðŸ¥³

Once you have completed all the modules, fill out the [Certificate of Completion Request form](https://learn.utoronto.ca/help/forms-and-applications/confirmation-completion-request) through the School of Continuing Studies to receive your microcredential. This process may take up to 4-6 weeks. As a reminder, 70% is the required threshold to pass.

Please also consider filling out [the final course evaluation form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=JsKqeAMvTUuQN7RtVsVSED10bCjLqktHgL2RqBGcPihUQjU4NFg3SFlWRzVGMUlDNVlZWjBJRjNGTy4u&route=shorturl) listed on your course syllabus as well as [the learner equity survey](https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=77R3YNHDHX3TKRLD).

Once you have received your microcredential, consider adding the corresponding badge your LinkedIn profile to promote your accomplishment. Likewise, we would love to see a social media post from you using the `#AcMicrocourses` hashtag with the Acceleration Consortium account tagged ([`@acceleration-consortium`](https://www.linkedin.com/company/acceleration-consortium/) for LinkedIn and [`@acceleration_c`](https://x.com/acceleration_c) for X).
