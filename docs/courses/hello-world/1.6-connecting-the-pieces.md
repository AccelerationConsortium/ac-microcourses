```{warning}
As a temporary workaround to the issue described in https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15112, add [`urequests_2.py`](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses/blob/main/docs/courses/hello-world/urequests_2.py) [[permalink](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses/blob/e5541ce3ec307a8e5e0f2b20f000c03f040e1f56/docs/courses/hello-world/urequests_2.py)] to your microcontroller, and change `import urequests` to `import urequests_2 as urequests` in the code below. See https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15112 and https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/pull/861 for ongoing updates. The corresponding assignment will also be affected, but this can be addressed using the same workaround.

```{include} ./mqtt-warning.md
```

You've made it to the final module of this microcourse! Well done ðŸ¥³. In this module, you will connect the pieces from previous modules into the "Hello World" of self-driving labs, from microcontroller programming and Bayesian optimization to hardware-software communication and data logging.

## Course Completion

For those who have completed the course, thank you for your participation, and congratulations! ðŸ¥³

Once you have completed all the modules, fill out the [Certificate of Completion Request form](https://learn.utoronto.ca/help/forms-and-applications/confirmation-completion-request) through the School of Continuing Studies to receive your microcredential. This process may take up to 4-6 weeks. As a reminder, 70% is the required threshold to pass.

Please also consider filling out [the final course evaluation form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=JsKqeAMvTUuQN7RtVsVSED10bCjLqktHgL2RqBGcPihUQjU4NFg3SFlWRzVGMUlDNVlZWjBJRjNGTy4u&route=shorturl) listed on your course syllabus as well as [the learner equity survey](https://redcap.utoronto.ca/surveys/?s=77R3YNHDHX3TKRLD).

Once you have received your microcredential, consider adding the corresponding badge your LinkedIn profile to promote your accomplishment. Likewise, we would love to see a social media post from you using the `#AcMicrocourses` hashtag with the Acceleration Consortium account tagged ([`@acceleration-consortium`](https://www.linkedin.com/company/acceleration-consortium/) for LinkedIn and [`@acceleration_c`](https://x.com/acceleration_c) for X).
