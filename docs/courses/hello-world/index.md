# Introduction to AI for Discovery using Self-driving Labs

<!-- In this course, you will build a minimal working example for a self-driving lab, starting with dimmable LEDs and a light sensor for a color-matching task and progressing through modules on microcontroller programming, Bayesian optimization, hardware/software communication, and database integration. This introductory course prepares you for advanced studies in data science, robotics, software development, and system design in later microcourses. -->
