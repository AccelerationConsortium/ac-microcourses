## 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs

<!--
```{note}
**This tutorial requires physical hardware and a 2.4 GHz WPA-2 wireless network**. If you do not have the hardware, see the ⭐ DigiKey Order link at the bottom-left of the [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/186289-autonomous-research-laboratories). If you do not have the required wireless network, you can use a mobile hotspot (see [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83)).
```

<!--
```{note}
🔑 The "Hello World" course is a **recommended prerequisite** for all other courses in the certificate, and a mandatory prerequisite for the in-person capstone project.
