# üí° Introduction to AI for Discovery using Self-driving Labs

Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) incorporate AI and automation into scientific laboratories to speed up the discovery of new materials for applications such as clean energy and cancer drugs. Discover the essential principles of SDLs by building a 'Hello World' SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication, database integration, microcontroller programming, and Bayesian optimization. Each of these are important components of an SDL, and you will get a taste of these in the course modules. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data.

## üîë Recommended Prerequisites

For participants to complete this course within the expected timeframe (approx. 20 hours), intermediate proficiency in Python programming is recommended.
