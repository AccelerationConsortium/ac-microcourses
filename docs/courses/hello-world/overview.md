# üí° Introduction to AI for Discovery using Self-driving Labs

Discover the essential principles of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) by building a 'Hello World' SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication via MQTT, database integration via MongoDB, microcontroller programming with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, and optimization via the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data.

Animated schematic diagram of the 'Hello World' demo: A microcontroller controls the LEDs and reads sensor data. The difference between the target color and the measured color is fed into an adaptive experimentation algorithm, and the process repeats itself.

## üîë Recommended Prerequisites

For participants to complete this course within the expected timeframe (approx. 20 hours), intermediate proficiency in Python programming is recommended.
