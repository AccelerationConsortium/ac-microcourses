# üí° Introduction to AI for Discovery using Self-driving Labs


```{note} Registration for this course is LIVE! Register [here](https://learn.utoronto.ca/programs-courses/courses/4010-introduction-ai-discovery-using-self-driving-labs). If you're already registered, your course will be available at https://q.utoronto.ca/.

Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) incorporate AI and automation into scientific laboratories to speed up the discovery of new materials for applications such as clean energy and cancer drugs. Discover the essential principles of SDLs by building a 'Hello World' SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication, database integration, microcontroller programming, and Bayesian optimization. Each of these are important components of an SDL, and you will get a taste of these in the course modules. In the final module, you will piece together the individual components to create your very own SDL demo. This introductory course will prepare you for deeper dives in data science, robotics, software development, and system design in later microcourses.

## üîë Recommended Prerequisites


```{include} ./hardware-note.md
```

For participants to complete this course within the expected timeframe (approx. 25 hours), at least beginner proficiency in Python programming is recommended. Those with advanced programming expertise will likely require a significantly shorter amount of time, whereas those with no prior programming experience may require 50 hours or more.




## üéØ Learning Outcomes


- Define and explain key terms and principles of self-driving labs to demonstrate understanding
- Apply MQTT or similar frameworks to send commands and receive sensor data over WiFi
- Demonstrate the ability to use MongoDB to store and retrieve experiment configurations and results effectively
- Develop and implement software on a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller to control device power and read sensor data accurately
- Modify a Bayesian optimization script using the Ax Platform to iteratively propose new experimental configurations
- Integrate the individual SDL components to orchestrate the full 'Hello World' workflow
