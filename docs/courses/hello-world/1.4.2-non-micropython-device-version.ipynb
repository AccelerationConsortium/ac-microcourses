        "This notebook serves as a replacement of [hardware/software communication notebook](./1.4-hardware-software-communication) if you were running on a device that supports Python (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5, Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.) where you can install the `paho-mqtt` Python library (as opposed to using the `mqtt_as` MicroPython library on a Pico W). This notebook can also be used directly with [the companion notebook](./1.4.1-onboard-led-temp.ipynb). Note that these examples do not consider the possibility of having multiple devices or sending simultaneous requests, for simplicity. However, in [`self-driving-lab-demo`](https://self-driving-lab-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), this is distinguished by passing an `experiment_id` back and forth, which is incorporated into the module assignment."
