Discover the essential principles of self-driving laboratories (SDLs) by building a "Hello World" SDL from scratch. In this asynchronous, remote course, you will build a self-driving color matcher using dimmable LEDs and a light sensor. This introduction will help you implement hardware/software communication via MQTT, database integration via MongoDB, microcontroller programming with a Raspberry Pi Pico W, and optimization via the Adaptive Experimentation (Ax) Platform. The course will conclude with an expansion of the demo to the research-relevant task of continuously logging temperature, humidity, pressure, light, and accelerometer data.
