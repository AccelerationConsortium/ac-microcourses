If you do not already have access to one, some alternatives include setting up a home network to broadcast both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks per your router's specific instructions, or perhaps easier - using a mobile hotspot in extended compatibility mode. Likewise, you may also use a SIM-enabled router. See some [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83) for more information about this topic.\n",
