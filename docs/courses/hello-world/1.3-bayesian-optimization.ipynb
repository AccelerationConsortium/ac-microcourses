    "For the mathematically inclined or those who would like to understand the theory behind Bayesian optimization, you are encouraged to work through [A Visual Exploration of Gaussian Processes](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/), which will give you a better sense of what Gaussian processes are and how Bayesian inference is used to perform Gaussian process regression. Note that Gaussian processes are the most widely used surrogate model in Bayesian optimization applications. Next, you can work through [Exploring Bayesian Optimization](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/). These two resources will help you to develop intuition about Bayesian optimization by understanding the underlying theory.\n",
