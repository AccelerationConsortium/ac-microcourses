**This course requires physical hardware and a 2.4 GHz WPA-2 wireless network**. If you do not have the hardware, see ["Before you Begin"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166723002964?via%3Dihub#sec1). If you do not have the required wireless network, you can use a mobile hotspot in extended compatibility mode or a SIM-enabled router (see [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83)).
