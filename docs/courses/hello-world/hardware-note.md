**This course requires physical hardware and a 2.4 GHz WPA-2 wireless network**. If you do not have the hardware, see the ‚≠ê "DigiKey Order" link at the bottom-left of the [hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/186289-autonomous-research-laboratories). If you do not have the required wireless network, you can use a mobile hotspot (see [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83)).
