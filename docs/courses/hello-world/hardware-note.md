**This course requires physical hardware and a 2.4 GHz WPA-2 wireless network**. If you do not have the hardware, you will need to purchase [the required components](https://www.digikey.com/short/4hhrzbvn), replacing the USB power adapter with the correct style for your country (e.g., [European type C](https://www.digikey.de/en/products/detail/cui-inc/SWI5-5-E-I38/5287193)), if necessary. You may also refer to ["Before you Begin"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166723002964?via%3Dihub#sec1). If you do not have the required wireless network, you can use a mobile hotspot in extended compatibility mode or a SIM-enabled router (see [recommendations](https://github.com/sparks-baird/self-driving-lab-demo/discussions/83) for more information).
