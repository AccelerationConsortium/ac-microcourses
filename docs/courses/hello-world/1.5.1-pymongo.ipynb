    "Within [the data logging notebook](./1.5-data-logging.ipynb), you learned how to write data to a MongoDB database directly from a microcontroller using MongoDB's data API. In this notebook, you will learn how to read data from a MongoDB database using the official MongoDB Python driver: [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Note that you will read data from a separate database collection than the one you wrote to in the previous notebook. While it would be more instructive to read the same data that you wrote, to avoid potential misuse, users only have write access to the database collection from the previous notebook. Likewise, in this notebook, users only have read access to a separate database collection with a fixed set of data."
