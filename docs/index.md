# 📜 Autonomous Systems for Discovery

Advanced materials hold the potential to improve our lives and our world, but traditional methods of discovery are slow and expensive. "Self-driving" laboratories (SDLs) have the power to fast-track materials discovery by using AI and robotics to run lab experiments autonomously. State-of-the-art SDLs require interdisciplinary teams and skillsets that traditional degree-based programs do not provide. To address this gap, the [Acceleration Consortium @ University of Toronto](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/) presents the *Autonomous Systems for Discovery* certificate containing short, hands-on courses that will provide familiarity with the terminology, principles, and tools of SDLs.

:class: only-light
The microcourses progress in three stages—introduction, deeper dives, and capstone—as shown. Courses #1-#4 are fully remote and asychronous, and the final capstone course will be conducted in-person at the [AC Training Lab](https://ac-training-lab.readthedocs.io/), where participants will have access to both educational and research-grade equipment.
