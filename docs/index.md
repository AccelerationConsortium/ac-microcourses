# 📜 Autonomous Systems for Discovery Certificate

```{warning}
This project is currently under development and the official microcredentials courses are not live. If you would like to participate or are interested in contributing, please [introduce yourself and join the discussion](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses/discussions/2).

While advanced materials hold the potential to improve our lives and our world, conventional methods of discovery are slow and expensive. "Self-driving" (i.e., autonomous) laboratories have the power to radically fast-track materials discovery—from an average of 20 years and \$100 million to as little as 1 year and \$1 million. This paradigm shift requires highly qualified personnel and multidisciplinary expertise. While extensive degree-based training can provide deep expertise in a single field, formal education options which provide needed cross-disciplinary skills are sparse. The Acceleration Consortium @ University of Toronto presents the *Autonomous Systems for Discovery* certificate to address this gap. This certificate contains a set of microcourses that introduces self-driving labs, provides deeper dives into data science, robotics, and software development, and facilitates a capstone project. Each course contains a series of hands-on guided tutorials and coding exercises for participants to adapt and apply what they've learned. This certificate will provide familiarity with the terminology, principles, and tools required for the highly interdisciplinary teams necessary to build state-of-the-art self-driving labs.

<!-- In the first course, participants will design and build a "Hello World" for self-driving labs using physical hardware and Python programming. The next three courses provide deeper dives into data science, robotics, and software development topics. These courses  will enable participants to iteratively suggest the next best experiment to perform, use a database backend to programatically upload and retrieve materials data, and orchestrate experimental and computational workflows. Likewise, participants will use software development tools and best practices to maximize efficiency and minimize frustration. The fifth and final course is a capstone project conducted in-person at the AC training lab, where participants will have access to both educational and research-grade equipment. -->

## 🎓 Microcourses

The *Autonomous Systems for Discovery* certificate consists of five core microcourses:

<!-- 1️⃣ 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs<br>
2️⃣ 📈 Data science for self-driving labs<br>
3️⃣ 🦾 Robotics for self-driving labs<br>
4️⃣ 🧑‍💻 Software development for self-driving labs<br>
5️⃣ 🏢 Capstone project at the AC training lab -->

> 💡 Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs<br>
> 📈 Data science for self-driving labs<br>
> 🦾 Robotics for self-driving labs<br>
> 🧑‍💻 Software development for self-driving labs<br>
> 🏢 Capstone project at the AC training lab


<!-- which participants will propose, develop, and defend a self-driving lab project. This will take place at the Acceleration Consortium's in-person training facility equipped with education- and research-grade equipment including liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms, a vertical lift module, and synthesis and characterization modules. -->

While the first four courses are fully remote and asychronous, the final capstone course will be conducted in-person at the AC training lab, where participants will have access to both educational and research-grade equipment.
