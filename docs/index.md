# 📜 Autonomous Systems for Discovery

<!--- Removed "Certificate" from title --->

```{warning}
This project is currently under development. If you would like to participate or are interested in contributing, please [introduce yourself and join the discussion](https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/ac-microcourses/discussions/2).
```

Advanced materials hold the potential to improve our lives and our world, but traditional methods of discovery are slow and expensive. "Self-driving" laboratories (SDLs) have the power to fast-track materials discovery by using AI and robotics to run lab experiments autonomously. State-of-the-art SDLs require interdisciplinary teams and skillsets that traditional degree-based programs do not provide. To address this gap, the [Acceleration Consortium @ University of Toronto](https://acceleration.utoronto.ca/) presents the *Autonomous Systems for Discovery* certificate containing short, hands-on courses that will provide familiarity with the terminology, principles, and tools of SDLs.

While the certificate option requires formal registration and tuition dues, the course content is made freely available.

## 🎓 Microcourses

The *Autonomous Systems for Discovery* certificate consists of five core microcourses and corresponding learning outcomes:

|  | Course Title | Learning Outcome |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 💡      | Building a "Hello World" for self-driving labs | Recreate a color-matching SDL from scratch using LEDs and a light sensor |
| 📈      | Data Science for self-driving labs | Write Python scripts to iteratively optimize materials and log results to a database |
| 🦾      | Robotics for self-driving labs | Write Python scripts to control robots and orchestrate workflows |
| 🧑‍💻      | Software Development for self-driving labs | Leverage software development tools and implement best practices |
| 🏢      | Capstone Project at the AC training lab | Develop, defend, and execute a project proposal |

<!-- which participants will propose, develop, and defend a self-driving lab project. This will take place at the Acceleration Consortium's in-person training facility equipped with education- and research-grade equipment including liquid handlers, solid dispensers, Cartesian-axis systems, mobile robotic arms, a vertical lift module, and synthesis and characterization modules. -->

<!-- While the first four courses are fully remote and asychronous, the final capstone course will be conducted in-person at the AC training lab, where participants will have access to both educational and research-grade equipment. -->

<!-- ## 🎯 Learning Outcomes -->


<!-- In the first course, participants will design and build a "Hello World" for self-driving labs using physical hardware and Python programming. The next three courses provide deeper dives into data science, robotics, and software development topics. These courses  will enable participants to iteratively suggest the next best experiment to perform, use a database backend to programatically upload and retrieve materials data, and orchestrate experimental and computational workflows. Likewise, participants will use software development tools and best practices to maximize efficiency and minimize frustration. The fifth and final course is a capstone project conducted in-person at the AC training lab, where participants will have access to both educational and research-grade equipment. -->

<!-- SVG Instructions

I first created the SVG using PowerPoint. Note that I put 99% transparent white boxes in front of the spots I want to be clickable. Kind of hacky, but with minimal effect.

After opening within inkscape: click on object, right click, and select "Link Properties.." (or create link). Insert the relative link into the href field, e.g., courses/robotics/overview.html

Inside of SVG file exported from inkscape, replace:

   width="2922"
   height="1876"

with the following:

   viewBox="0 0 2922 1876"
   width="100%"
   height="100%"
